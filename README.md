# Files and Execution
main.py
This file adheres to the format requirements of the CAD contest. However, we do not recommend running this file directly. Instead, please use run_all.py to see the results.

run_all.py
This script includes all combinations of netlists and cost estimators. A netlist is optimized through logic synthesis simulated annealing and technological mapping simulated annealing. The cost results are displayed in the terminal.
Run this file directly. It may take up to an hour to complete, but you can stop it at any time.
